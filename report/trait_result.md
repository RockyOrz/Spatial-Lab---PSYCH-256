| Trial | Condition | Gold | Pred | Conf | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BatchRun_HighSym_1Axis_HighMag_1765540416838\Trial_1 | HIGH_SYMMETRY | ONE_AXIS | HIGH | B | B | 78.0 | OK | The reference forms a 2-cube-high column with a 2-cube top cap extending to one side and a single cube protruding at the bottom on the opposite side (seen by comparing front vs 180° back). Candidate B matches this same stepped arrangement under rotation. Candidate A is a flatter 2×3 slab-like layout without the distinct bottom single-cube protrusion. |
| BatchRun_HighSym_1Axis_HighMag_1765540416838\Trial_2 | HIGH_SYMMETRY | ONE_AXIS | HIGH | B | B | 78.0 | OK | The reference is a 5-cube stepped shape: a 2-cube vertical stack with a 2-cube horizontal run attached at the top, plus one extra cube attached to the side of the lower cube (seen clearly in the 180° view). Candidate B matches this connectivity under rotation. Candidate C is a symmetric cross-like arrangement, which the reference is not. |
| BatchRun_HighSym_1Axis_HighMag_1765540416838\Trial_3 | HIGH_SYMMETRY | ONE_AXIS | HIGH | C | B | 78.0 | WRONG | The reference forms a 2-high 2×1 pillar with a 2-cube top cap offset to one side and a single cube protruding from the opposite lower side (seen in the 180° view). Candidate B matches this same stepped arrangement under rotation. Candidate C is a continuous C-shaped ring-like bend with no isolated single-cube lower protrusion, so it’s structurally different. |
| BatchRun_HighSym_1Axis_HighMag_1765540416838\Trial_4 | HIGH_SYMMETRY | ONE_AXIS | HIGH | A | B | 78.0 | WRONG | The reference is a 5-cube shape: a 2-cube vertical stack with a 2-cube bar attached at the top and a single cube attached at the bottom on the opposite side (confirmed by the 180° back view). Candidate B matches this arrangement under rotation. Candidate C is a symmetric cross-like layout with arms on multiple sides, which the reference does not have. |
| BatchRun_HighSym_1Axis_HighMag_1765540416838\Trial_5 | HIGH_SYMMETRY | ONE_AXIS | HIGH | C | B | 78.0 | WRONG | The reference forms a 2-cube-high block with a 2-cube top footprint and a single-cube ‘foot’ protruding from the lower level on one side; Candidate B matches this arrangement under rotation. Candidate A is a flat 2D slab-like arrangement (no single lower protruding cube), and Candidate C has a different stepped/arched underside structure. |
